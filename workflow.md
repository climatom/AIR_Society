# Workflow steps
1. List coordinates of glacial lakes (GL) worldwide (Furian et al 2022).
2. Obtain mean winter temperature, wind speed and humidity of these locations to calculate max freezing rates.
3. Obtain mean summer temperature, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation of these locations to calculate max melting rates.
4. Select GLs which can create Perpetual Ice Reservoirs (PIRs)

# Key questions
1. When does PIR meltwater become greater than the associated glacier meltwater ?

# Figures
1. Potential GLOFs ranked based on risk and PIR potential.
