# Workflow steps
## Option 1
1. List coordinates of glacial lakes (GL) worldwide (Furian et al 2022).
2. Obtain mean winter temperature, wind speed and humidity of these locations to calculate mean freezing rates.
3. Obtain mean summer temperature, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation of these locations to calculate mean melting rates.
4. Select GLs which can sustain Perpetual Ice Reservoirs (PIRs)

### Key questions
1. When does PIR meltwater become greater than the associated glacier meltwater ?

### Figures
1. Potential GLOFs ranked based on risk and PIR potential.

## Option 2
1. Select coordinates based on "favourable" climate and "sufficient" water supply.
2. Obtain mean winter temperature, wind speed and humidity of these locations to calculate mean freezing rates.
3. Obtain mean summer temperature, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation of these locations to calculate mean melting rates.
4. Select favourable locations which can sustain Perpetual Ice Reservoirs (PIRs)

### Key questions
1. How to define favourable sites using historical weather and location information? 
2. How to locate water resources near these sites ?

### Figures
1. Worldwide distribution of PIRs

### ERA5 Masks
1. Mean land temperature in atleast 3 months of the year is subzero. 
2. Population of the region atleast ?
3. Glacial lake masks
4. Altitude of the region atleast ?
